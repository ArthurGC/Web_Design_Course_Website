                <p>This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create
                    interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to
                    develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers
                    accessible. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating
                    your growth as a web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will include your
                    ability to design and implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is
                    accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive
                    impairments.</p>

                        <p class="courses__p">This course is designed to help the novice who wants to gain
                            confidence and knowledge. We will explore the theory (what actually happens when you click
                            on a link on a webpage?), the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and
                            the overlooked (I have a page, what do I do now?). Throughout the course there will be a
                            strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic standards to
                            promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities. </p>

                            The styling of a webpage can take enhance your page. When done
                            incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all. To ensure that your sites do not
                            put up barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how
                            to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines. Upon completion of
                            the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page. Using that
                            design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and layouts.</p>

                            This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language. We will cover
                            concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.
                            You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify
                            and modify specific parts of your page. After the course, learners will be able to react to
                            DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page. The class will
                            culminate in a final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and
                            verifies input.</p>

                            This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as
                            wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as
                            Bootstrap. After the course, learners will be able to:
                            ** Explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase
                            ** Create sites that behave across a range of platforms
                            ** Utilize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap</p>
