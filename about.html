                <p>This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create
                    interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to
                    develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers
                    accessible. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating
                    your growth as a web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will include your
                    ability to design and implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is
                    accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive
                    impairments.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction to HTML5</h3>
                        <p>Thanks to a growing number of software programs, it seems as if anyone can make a webpage.
                            But what if you actually want to understand how the page was created? There are great
                            textbooks and online resources for learning web design, but most of those resources require
                            some background knowledge. This course is designed to help the novice who wants to gain
                            confidence and knowledge. We will explore the theory (what actually happens when you click
                            on a link on a webpage?), the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and
                            the overlooked (I have a page, what do I do now?). Throughout the course there will be a
                            strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic standards to
                            promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities. </p>

                        <h3>Introduction to HTML5</h3>
                        <p>The web today is almost unrecognizable from the early days of white pages with lists of blue
                            links. Now, sites are designed with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color
                            schemes. This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3). The emphasis
                            will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good
                            programming habits.
                            When done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance your page. When done
                            incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all. To ensure that your sites do not
                            put up barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how
                            to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines. Upon completion of
                            the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page. Using that
                            design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and layouts.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction to HTML5</h3>
                        <p>If you want to take your website to the next level, the ability to incorporate interactivity
                            is a must. But adding some of these types of capabilities requires a stronger programming
                            language than HTML5 or CSS3, and JavaScript can provide just what you need. With just a
                            basic understanding of the language, you can create a page that will react to common events
                            such as page loads, mouse clicks & movements, and even keyboard input.
                            This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language. We will cover
                            concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.
                            You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify
                            and modify specific parts of your page. After the course, learners will be able to react to
                            DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page. The class will
                            culminate in a final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and
                            verifies input.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction to HTML5</h3>
                        <p>It used to be the case that everyone viewed webpages on about the same size screen. But with
                            the explosion of the use of smartphones to access the Internet, the landscape of design has
                            completely changed. People viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless
                            of the platform (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer). This ability to respond
                            to any platform is called responsive design.
                            This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as
                            wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as
                            Bootstrap. After the course, learners will be able to:
                            ** Explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase
                            ** Create sites that behave across a range of platforms
                            ** Utilize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap</p>
